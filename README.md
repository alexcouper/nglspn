# Naglasúpan

## The story (brief mode)

>There once was a village, where people stayed inside, afraid to come out.
>
>A traveller came to the village
>
>He brought with him some nails and began to make a soup
>
>People came out of their homes to find out what was being made
>
>"A nail soup", said the man, "it's going to be delicious, it's not quite ready though, it just needs something"
>
>"I've got some carrots", said one villager
>
>Another offered some celery, salt another, and so on and so forth
>
>Until finally a great feast was had.

## The aim

The aim of this project is to be that Naglasúpan for side projects/developer initiatives in Iceland.
To provide a place where we can contribute the projects we're working on, show them off, get feedback, collaborate, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a WIP and many features are needed to fulfil the idea. But that's the easy bit

## Getting started

Claude should do a decent job of finding out, but basically there's a BACKEND and FRONTEND.

cd src/django-backend
make bootstrap          # create db
make seed               # create some test data
make dev

cd src/web-ui
make install
make dev

Should be good to go.
