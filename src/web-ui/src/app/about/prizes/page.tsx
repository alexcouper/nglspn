Projects must be built by Iceland-based developers. Projects can be at any stage of development, from idea to launched product.

The aim is to encourage general software development too, so web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, libraries, CLIs, etc are all fair game.

Initially the focus is on side projects, but if you have a full time project that you're working on that you're willing to share and get feedback on, that's fine too.
`

const selection = `
Winners are currently being selected by Alex Couper who is largely making it up as he goes along.

We're looking for a panel of judges to make these decisions going forward. If you're interested in get in touch via [discord](https://discord.gg/DqUV64g7JE) or [email](mailto:alex@naglasupan.is).

Prize frequency will be variable dependent on uptake, but somewhere in the weekly-monthly range.

Prize sizes and quantity will depend on sponsorships, but we're good for a few months at least.
